## Student's T-Test
&nbsp;

- Student's ***t-test*** is one of statistical hypothesis tests which is performed when the test statistics is assumed to follow a Student's t-distribution under the null hypothesis. 
- It is usually used to compare means of two samples to see if they are equal or not.
- There are different types of t-test, so we should be aware of which t-test to choose.

The diagram above briefly shows which significance test to choose from, when you perform statistical hypothesis tests. You can see several types of t-tests, but in this post I will only cover the most fundamental t-tests that are used for comparing two sampes: paired(dependent) t-test, unpaired(independent) t-test 

&nbsp;

### Unpaired t-test
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Unpaired t-test assumes that two sample groups are independent and from an approximately normal distribution. The formula differs depending on the equivalence or variance.

&nbsp;

#### Equal variance
&nbsp;
parameters:
- $$\bar{x_1}, \bar{x_2}$$ is mean value of group 1 and group 2 
- $$n_1, n_2$$ are numbers of samples of group 1 and group 2

- t-test statistics value: $$t = \frac{\bar{x_{1}}+\bar{x_{2}}}{\sqrt {s^2\biggl(\frac{1}{n_{1}}+\frac{1}{n_{2}}\biggr)}}$$
<br/>

- pooled sample variance: $$s^2 = {\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} (x_i - \bar{x_1})^2 + \sum_{j=1}^{n_2} (x_j - \bar{x_2})^2\over n_1 + n_2 - 2}$$


- degree of freedom: $$df = n-1$$

<br/>
#### R Code
<br/>
```R

t.test(x, y, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = TRUE)

# or

t.test(dataset$y1, dataset$y2, data = my_data, var.equal = TRUE)
```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#### Non-equal variance
&nbsp;
parameters:

- t-test statistics value: $$d = \frac{\bar{x_1}+\bar{x_2}}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}$$
<br/>

- group 1 sample variance: $$s_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} (x_i - \bar{x_1})^2}{n_1 -1}$$

- group 2 sample variance: $$s_2 = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{n_2} (x_j - \bar{x_2})^2}{n_2 -1}$$

- degree of freedom: $$df = {\biggl[\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}\biggr]\over {\bigl(\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}\bigr)^2\over n_1 - 1} + {\bigl(\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}\bigr)^2\over n_2 - 1} }$$

<br/>
#### R Code
<br/>
```R

t.test(x, y, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE)

# or

t.test(dataset$y1, dataset$y2, data = my_data, var.equal = FALSE)
```
 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Paired t-test
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Unlike, unpaired t-test, paired t-test is used to compare sample menas of two **related(dependent) groups** (ex. pair of values; before & after)

parameters:
- t-test statistics value: $$t = \frac{m}{\frac{s}{\sqrt n}}$$
  - $$m$$ is the mean difference between two groups 
  - $$n$$ is the sample size of $$d$$
  - $$s$$ is the standard devidation of $$d$$
- $$df$$(degree of freedom) is $$n-1$$

<br/>
#### R Code
<br/>
```R

t.test (Y ~ X, dataset, paired=TRUE)

# or 

t.test(dataset$y1, dataset$y2, paired=TRUE)


```
