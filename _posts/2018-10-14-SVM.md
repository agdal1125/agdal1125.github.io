Support Vector Machine (a.k.a **SVM**) is one of the famous machine learning techniques. It is mainly used for supervised machine learning(classification) and regression analysis. It uses the concept of **hyperplane** for optimal classification. 

- Suited for extreme cases ( Segregates two classes with a vector gap)
- Only **support vectors** are important, whereas other training examples are relatively unimportant
- Use **support vectors** to find hyperplane that maximize the margin between classified groups
- Depending on the circumstances, it can be linear or non-linear
- **Kernel** function can be used to transform non-linear into higher dimensional feature space to make linear separation possible. This is called kernel trick (see image below)
