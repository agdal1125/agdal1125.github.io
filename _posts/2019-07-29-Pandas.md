## Pandas

<br>

Pandas is a python data analysis toolkit that provides fast, flexible and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data in easy and intuitive way. The name pandas came from the term "panel data". Anyone interested in Data Analysis using python should better get familar with this library.

<br>

There are many posts, books and even official documentations that explains how to make use of this wonderful library. In this post, I would like to discuss practical techniques and summarize the gist of pandas. 

<br>

### DataFrame

<br>

Pandas has two types of data structure:

- Series : 1-Dimensional
- DataFrame: 2-Dimensional

<br>

*For more basic tutorial about Pandas and numpy, please check my [tutorial](https://github.com/agdal1125/CK2/blob/master/Day%201/Chapter%205%20-%20Data%20Manipulation%20II%20(Pandas).ipynb) on the GitHub*

Dataframe is an expression of data into a tabular form. In pandas, three elements are used to create dataframe: column (variable name), row (data), and index. Dataframe can be created from different forms of python data types. List, dictionary, pandas series, and numpy ndarray can be used to make Dataframe. Example codes are presented below:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# numpy 2d array to dataframe
nd_array = np.array([[0,1,2],[3,4,5]])
n2darray_to_df = pd.DataFrame(nd_array)

# dictionary to dataframe
my_dict = {"name": ["Jake","Mike"],"age":["26","14"],"gender":["male","female"]}
dict_to_df = pd.DataFrame(my_dict)

# pandas series to dataframe
my_series = pd.Series({"Korea":"Kimchi","Japan":"Sushi","India":"Curry"})
series_to_df = pd.DataFrame(my_series)
```

## Accessing data in DataFrame

<br>

DataFrame is very similar to spreadsheets that you can see on Excel. Just as Microsoft Excel, you can access to specific parts of data by filtering and indexing your DataFrame. We will use [this data]({{ "/assets/pd_tutorial.csv" | absolute_url }}) for demonstration.
