### Pandas

<br>

Pandas is a free data analysis and manipulation library for python.  The name pandas came from the term "panel data". Anyone interested in Data Analysis using python should better get familar with this library.

<br>

There are many posts, books and even official documentations that explains how to make use of this wonderful library. In this post, I would like to discuss practical techniques and summarize the gist of pandas. 

<br>

#### DataFrame

<br>

Dataframe is an expression of data into a tabular form. In pandas, three elements are used to create dataframe: column (variable name), row (data), and index. Dataframe can be created from different forms of python data types. List, dictionary, pandas series, and numpy ndarray can be used to make Dataframe. Example codes are presented below:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# numpy 2d array to dataframe
nd_array = np.array([[0,1,2],[3,4,5]])
n2darray_to_df = pd.DataFrame(nd_array)

# dictionary to dataframe
my_dict = {"name": ["Jake","Mike"],"age":["26","14"],"gender":["male","female"]}
dict_to_df = pd.DataFrame(my_dict)

# pandas series to dataframe
my_series = pd.Series({"Korea":"Kimchi","Japan":"Sushi","India":"Curry"})
series_to_df = pd.DataFrame(my_series)
```
