"We can definitely save astronaut's life by using seatbelts in the car!"

You would probably laugh at this statement, because it is pretty obvious that this is a **spurious correlation**. Many research papers and people make mistakes by associating correlation with causality. 

**"Correlation does not imply causation"**. It does not guarantee anything, but only shows a possibility

<br>

​	*A.  Strong positive correlation between annual ice-cream sales and number of drownings*

​	*B.  Strong positive correlation between number of bars and churches in the city*

​	*C.  Strong positive correlation between life expenctancy and hormone supplements for middle aged*

<br>

The following correlations above are all fallacious. More logical reason or cause of *A* would be seasonal changes. You would eat more ice cream and swim on the hot summer than in the cold winter. *B* is just an observation based on different size of cities. Of course you would have more churches and bars in New York than in Alaska. *C* is a bit tricky, but "money" turns out to be the causal factor behind this correlation. The richer you are, the more you can afford to spend on your health.

Likewise, high correlation fools us to think that there is an actual casual relationship between the two variables. Here are some types of correlation mistakes:

<p></p>

1. **Spurious Correlation**

   All the examples that we have talked about above, is spurious correlation. This is a deceptive association due to some other variables in between them. Season, size of the city, money were the hidden key variables in these cases. 

   &nbsp;

2. **Coincidental Correlation**

   "Annual number of people drowned by falling into a swimming pool has high correlation with the annual number of films Nicholas Cage appeared in". The two figures are just a coincidence. We cannot blame Nicholas Cage for the death of all drowned people in the swimming pool. This is what we call coincidental correlation.  

&nbsp;

Once again, Correlation does not lead to Causation. So, be careful with your correlation coefficient.

## Base Rate Fallacy (Base Rate Neglect)

Another logical fallacy that can be frequently seen is
