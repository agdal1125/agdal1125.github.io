# SQL (to be Updated)
&nbsp;

- Structured Query Language (SQL), is a programming language used to manage or process data in *Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)*
- SQL is useful in handling **structured data** that includes relations between different data tables
- SQL is used to create, manage, query, manipulate the data with *statements*

## Basic Statements

### SELECT

&nbsp;
SELECT is used to select data from a database (most statements are self-explanatory...)
> SELECT column1, column2, ...
> FROM table_name;

&nbsp;

If you want to select all columns, simply use * (asterisk)
> SELECT * FROM table_name;

&nbsp;

If you want to select only unique or different values, use **DISTINCT**
> SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
> FROM table_name;

&nbsp;

If you want to select values with certain conditions, use  **WHERE**
> SELECT column1, column2, ...
> FROM table_name
> WHERE condition;

The following are operations that can be used with the WHERE clause:

| Operator |                   Description                   |
|----------|:-----------------------------------------------:|
| =        |                      equal                      |
| <> or != |                    not equal                    |
| <        |                    less than                    |
| >        |                   greater than                  |
| BETWEEN  |                 between a range                 |
| LIKE     |                  pattern search                 |
| IN       | specify multiple values  as an inclusive syntax |

#### Example
> SELECT DISTINCT * FROM product_info WHERE price > 40;

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;


### AND, OR, NOT 

&nbsp;
AND, OR, and NOT operators are combined with other statements to filter records in a more desirably way. It is used in a similar manner just as in other programming languages.

- **AND** displays a record if **all** the conditions stated and connected with AND are **TRUE**
- **OR** displays a record if **any** conditions stated with OR are **TRUE**
- **NOT** displays a record if the conditions is **NOT TRUE**

&nbsp;

#### Examples
> SELECT *
> FROM product_info
> WHERE price BETWEEN 20 AND 30

> SELECT *
> FROM product_info
> WHERE color = "red" OR "blue"
