## Pandas Tricks

<br>

In the previous post, basic usage of pandas was explained. In this post, more technical and useful tricks will be introduced. The following list of contents will be covered:

- Transpose
- Correlation
- Column Manipulation (re-ordering, re-naming, etc.)
- 

<br>

There are many posts, books and even official documentations that explains how to make use of this wonderful library. In this post, I would like to discuss practical techniques and summarize the gist of pandas. 

<br>

### Transpose

<br>



```python
import pandas as pd

# Generate DataFrame for example
df = pd.DataFrame()
```

<br>

## Accessing data in DataFrame

<br>

DataFrame is very similar to spreadsheets that you can see on Excel. Just as Microsoft Excel, you can access to specific parts of data by filtering and indexing your DataFrame. We will use [this data]({{ "/assets/pd_tutorial.csv" | absolute_url }}) for demonstration.

<br>

#### Reading Data 

<p>In order to open your csv (comma seperated version) file, all you need is one line of code after the import:</p>
```python
#importing pandas library
import pandas as pd               

# Reading file
df = pd.read_csv("YOUR DIRECTORY/pd_tutorial.csv") 

# Displaying a few lines on the top of the file
df.head()        

# Shows the size of your data in a tuple
df.shape
```

<br>

<br>

#### Indexing, Filtering and Selection

In order to analyze data, one should be able to properly manipulate, select and retrieve their subject data. This means that proficiency in indexing, filtering and selection determines the efficiency of work. This is the main reason why I wrote and organized this post.

<br>

**1. iloc, loc**

These are the most basic functions used to find data from dataframe.

- **iloc** : uses integer position to find values. Labels and strings are not supported
- **loc**: uses label to find values. 

<br>

<br>

**2. Indexing**

<p>Similar to indexing with lists, Pandas dataframes can also be indexed in a similar way. </p>
```python
# Retrieving a specific column
df["COLUMN NAME"]  # Returns pandas.Series
df[["COLUMN NAME"]] # Returns pandas.DataFrame

# Retrieving multiple columns
df[["COLUMN 1", "COLUMN 2"]] # Returns pandas.DataFrame

# Retrieving specific rows
df[ num1 : num2 ] # Returns rows from index num1 to num2 - 1
```

<br>

<br>

**3. Using Conditions**

<p>You can make use of conditions to filter data of your interest too. If the outcome of respective conditions produce boolean values, the filtering would turnout fine. The example below gets crime data which occurred in district 3 with "Traffic" included in the crime description. The function *.head()* is similar to SQL query *LIMIT*. It is used to retrieve the requested amount of lines of data. In the example, 10 lines are retrieved as a result.</p>
```python
# dataframe[ ( CONDITION1 )   OPERATOR  ( CONDITION2 ) ]

# OPERATOR
& # for and
| # for or
^ # for xor

# CONDITION Examples
# value 4 only from a column
dataframe["COLUMN NAME"] == 4 

# values larger than 4 from a column
dataframe["COLUMN NAME"] > 4 

# value that includes keyword "APPLE" from a column
dataframe["COLUMN NAME"].str.contains("APPLE") 

# value without keyword "APPLE" from a column
~dataframe["COLUMN NAME"].str.contains("APPLE") 
```

So, this was probably the basic manipulations that you can do with pandas. In the next post, I will cover the "fancy" tricks.
