### How I met Data Science

The very first "plausible" dream that I had as a child was a diplomat.

 Due to my parent's frequent job relocations, I faced utterly different environments, sometimes parting with family, and experienced diverse culture from Arabic to Western to Asian. When overcoming linguistic barriers, I tried to be observant. Considering the context behind the spoken language and using relevant knowledge, I trained myself to infer the meaning of the unknown words. Learning and studying language has always been fun for me, and this background led me to become a student of foreign language specialized high school. I never knew my interest in language led me to a specific field of Data Science: Natural Langauge Processing.

Nevertheless, I chose my major as technology management (which was somewhat irrelevant to my interest) due to unexpected factors that sometimes happen in life. However, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise. I met one of the most influential person in my life, professor Keeheon Lee, who guided me to the path of Data Science. I assisted him in conducting numerous research projects and writing scientific papers as an undergraduate researcher. Through this experience, I learned how to manage research, and collect, manipulate and visualize data. 

Along with the undergraduate research assistant experience, I studied countless of business cases where proper use of data can improve efficiency, promote safety, and deliver many types of values. Inspired by these cases, I chose Data Science as my lifelong profession. 

After the decision, I worked with several companies to practice my skills and gain industrial experience.

As a Data Scientist intern at Deloitte Consulting Korea, I worked on a project that aims to develop a Question Answering system for insurance underwriting. Challenging problems of named entity recognition and resolution of semantic or lexical ambiguity with highly messy data captured my interest. 

While working with Crevasse AI, I encountered different types of GANs(Generative Adverserial Network). I worked with Image segmentation using FCN, studied InfoGAN, StyleGAN and wrote a demo-version for the company. 

The series of experience in business industry opened my eyes toward NLP and Image Processing. Since then, I decided to pursue a higher degree to polish my skills and improve capacity for digesting knowledge of the field of my interst.
